Remove deprecated `cssUrls` option from `HandlePrachtRequestOptions` and `PrerenderAppOptions` (superseded by `cssManifest`), and remove the deprecated `useRevalidateRoute` alias (use `useRevalidate` instead). The `NodeAdapterOptions.cssUrls` field, which was never forwarded to the framework, is also removed.
